# DSA Standard C

A C library implementing common data structures and algorithms typically encountered in technical interviews and LeetCode-style problems.

## Current Implementations
- Binary Search
- Selection Sort

Each implementation comes with comprehensive CUnit tests demonstrating correctness.

## Planned Implementations
Common interview/LeetCode patterns:
- Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort
- Data Structures: Hash Maps, Binary Trees, Graphs
- Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's
- Two Pointers/Sliding Window implementations
- Dynamic Programming examples
- String manipulation algorithms
- Stack/Queue based solutions

## Building and Testing
Project uses Make for building and CUnit for testing.

```bash
make        # build the project
make test   # run the test suite
```

## Project Structure
```
include/   # Header files
src/       # Implementation files
test/      # CUnit test files
```

## Development Status
Active development - new algorithms and data structures being added regularly.
